## Requirements

Make sure you have OpenJDK 19 installed before opening the project.


## Run instructions

Open the project in IntelliJ go to the main class and press the green start button.

## Project

Open the project. You can put your files in the `com.nhlstenden.windturbines` package. There should be a `Main.java` 
by default. 
The `Main.java` should not contain any errors.

### Errors

If you see any errors in the `Main.java` class, then there is something wrong with the following:

- You don't have OpenJDK 19 installed.
- The library is not present. Make sure there is a folder `lib` in the root. This folder should contain the file 
`smarthome-display.jar`. 
- The library is not attached to the project. Right-mouse click on the project. Click `Open Module Settings`. Go to 
`Libraries`. Click the `+` sign and then `Java`. Select the `.jar` file from the `lib` folder.
